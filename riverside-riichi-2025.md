## Transport and accommodation

Bristol Bridge Club is in the Hotwells area, about a 30 minute walk from the city centre, along the scenic Floating Harbour.

[Travelodge](https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/78/Bristol-Central-hotel) and [Ibis](https://all.accor.com/hotel/5547/index.en.shtml) both have conveniently located hotels along the harbourside.

The Clifton area is geographically close by, with many hotel options, but be aware that it is up an extremely steep hill!

#### From the airport

Transport from Bristol Airport to the centre is primarily via the A1 "Airport Flyer" bus. A ticket is £9 single and £15 return (within 1 month). The closest A1 stop to the venue is Redcliff Hill, from which you can catch an m2 bus or walk 35 minutes.

#### By public transport

Bristol's main train station is Temple Meads, which is a 45 minute walk from the venue, again along the harbourside.

To skip the walk, the m2 and number 9 buses should get you to the venue in about 30 minutes.

You could also hire an e-scooter or e-bike using the Dott app and ride it along the relatively quiet Cumberland Road - just be sure to prepare the app in advance (you must submit your driving license to ride the scooters).

#### By car

**Free on-street parking** is available **on Sunday only** (it is restricted to local permit holders on Saturdays). Check the area ringed in the screenshot below, covering the residential roads in Hotwells around the venue, and also just over the river on the western end of Spike Island. There is normally plenty of space. Be aware that this lies within Bristol's Clean Air Zone and that some vehicles incur a £9 daily charge - check at [https://www.gov.uk/clean-air-zones](https://www.gov.uk/clean-air-zones).

**Park and Ride** is available from Long Ashton in southwest Bristol. (This is outside the Clean Air Zone.) Parking is free and the bus fare is £2.40 single. The m2 bus departs every 15 minutes and will deliver you to the Cumberland Basin bus stop in just 5 minutes. From there it’s a further 5 minute walk to the venue.

While there are local car parks, they all have a max stay of 4 hours, so this is not recommended.
