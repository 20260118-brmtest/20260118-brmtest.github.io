Our next meetup is on Saturday 6th December!

Where: Watershed Cinema Café Bar

Time: 10am to 4.30pm **(note fixed end time)**
If there are still players wanting to play after 4.30 then we will try to find a new venue :)

If you know the rules, you can come play - all abilities welcome!

No entry fee, but please purchase food and drink from the venue to support them!

No need to sign up.

It's recommended to arrive at 10am sharp so you can join the initial round of games. If you'd like to arrive later, it's appreciated to let us know so we can plan. See [how to chat to us](/about/#how-to-chat-to-us).
