Our next meetup is on Sunday 9th March!

Where: Watershed Cinema Café Bar

Start: 10am

No fixed end time - if there are players, we keep playing! Normally it finishes around dinnertime, 6pm-ish.

All abilities welcome. Never played before? We can teach you!

No entry fee, but please purchase food and drink from the venue to support them!

If you're planning on coming, letting us know in advance is appreciated (to help with planning tables) but not required! See [how to chat to us](/about/#how-to-chat-to-us).
