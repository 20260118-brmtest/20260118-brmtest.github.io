Another Tuesday event at Beer Emporium!

Where: Beer Emporium (15 King Street, Bristol, BS1 4EF)

Time: 18:15-late

If you know the rules, you can come play - all abilities welcome!

No entry fee, but please purchase food and drink from the venue to support them.

No need to sign up.

The focus will be on 4-player games, with some alternatives thrown in to ensure everyone who attends is included - some 5-player games (with a rotating sit-out position), maybe the odd 3-player game, or perhaps some study/training sessions similar to our Road to Riverside events from last year.

It's recommended to arrive near the start, so you can join the initial round of games. If you'd like to arrive later, it's appreciated to let us know so we can plan. See [how to chat to us](/about/#how-to-chat-to-us).
