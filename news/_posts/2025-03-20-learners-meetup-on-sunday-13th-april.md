We've heard from lots of new players via Facebook, Discord and email looking for an introduction to riichi mahjong, so the next meetup is just that!

Where: Watershed Cinema Café Bar

When: 10am-1pm (perhaps longer if attendees want to keep playing!)

Please do arrive close to 10am so we can begin the teaching from the same point for everybody 😀

As ever, let us know if you're planning on coming!

Anyone is welcome, at all skill levels, including existing players who would like to help with teaching. The only difference to a normal meetup is an emphasis on setting up tables of four going at an appropriate pace for first-timers. If we have a surplus of existing players then they are of course welcome to engage in regular play 😀

If you _are_ a first-timer and would like to begin your learning a little early, I can wholeheartedly recommend the Light Grunty channel on YouTube:

Start, of course, with The Basics; if you finish, you can move on to Yaku and Scoring, and then Basic Strategy. I hope you'll find it helpful! They are great lessons - just don't worry about memorising the Japanese terms that the teacher introduces - you don't need them just yet!
