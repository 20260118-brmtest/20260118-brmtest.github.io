- Saturday 12th July - [Road to Riverside] Training event
- Saturday 30th August - Casual meetup
- Saturday 6th September - [Road to Riverside] Mock tournament
- 25th-26th October - Riverside Riichi 2025

Let's start with the big one!

## Riverside Riichi

I'm thrilled to announce that we've applied for EMA approval for an official tournament happening in Bristol on 25th-26th October 2025!

Taking place at Bristol Bridge Club, on the banks of the Floating Harbour, in the shadow of the Clifton Suspension Bridge crossing the River Avon...the tournament will be called **Riverside Riichi 2025**!

This website will host a dedicated page for the tournament once we get EMA approval and have all the little details smoothed out. Watch this space!

I can't wait to welcome the incredible European riichi community to our city, and watch on as some of Europe's strongest players battle it out in Bristol!

## Road to Riverside

Of course, we also hope to see lots of our club members playing at the tournament - and hopefully winning 😊 With this in mind, we have the **Road to Riverside** meetups!

These are focused on existing tournament players who'd like to hone their skills, and also club regulars who may be looking to make the step up to tournament play.

On Saturday 12th July we will have a **training meetup** - the plan is to pair each player with an observer, who watches their play and identifies interesting discussion points to raise to the whole table. Then player and observer swap places, so everyone gets a chance to play. Watching others is one of the fastest ways I know to expand your mahjong mind to see the variety of different approaches that can work in this game!

Then, on Saturday 6th September we plan to host a **mock EMA tournament** day!

## More meetups!

We aren't abandoning our usual programme of casual meetups!

Saturday 31st May - we'll do our usual Watershed meetup followed by an **evening social** with a table booked at Three Brothers Burgers! More details in a separate post on this site!

The **learners' meetup** last month was our most popular event to date and we'll repeat it on Sunday 22nd June!

A meetup is also in the diary for Saturday 30th August 😊

We look forward to seeing all of you for much more mahjong in 2025!
