Thanks and well done to the 20 participants in our 2025 team event!

In the end it was the Men of Man who took victory - congratuations 👏

Also, Ewen will be taking home a new Junk Mat and tile set after winning in our raffle!

Big thanks to James for co-organising and Bristol Bridge Club for an excellent job hosting us 🎉
