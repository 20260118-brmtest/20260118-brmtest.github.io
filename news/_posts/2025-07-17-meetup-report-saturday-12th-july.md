14 people came along to the bridge club for a Bristol Riichi Mahjong session with a twist!

The photo above is from the start of the day. With 11 people, we decided to have just one table of play, with 7 observers taking photos of interesting decisions made by the players.

After each hand the whole table reviewed the hand to share strategy tips and new insights.

We managed to start up a second table after lunch after some new arrivals and a yummy pizza break!

The signup for Riverside Riichi 2025 launches very soon, so please watch this space!!
