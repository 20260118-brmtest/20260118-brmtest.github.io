16 players came to Bristol Bridge Club to try out a day of mahjong tournament play!

A day of fierce competition over 4 hanchan saw tight battles at both ends of the table.

Finding no luck in his first three hanchan with three 4th places, Derek's slingshot was well and truly loaded and ready to let loose. A yakuman or two would help!! No such heroics to be seen this time, but he did end with a win and avoided last place by the narrowest of margins. We applaud his spirit!

Perhaps the most impressive performance of the day came from Kylie, new not just to our meetups, but to live riichi play altogether. Unfazed, she won against two of the top three in the final game to secure 4th place overall. Bravo - we look forward to seeing you play again!

Danny, individual top scorer of our 2024 team event, led proceedings for most of the day with solid scores. His margin before the final round was a decent, if not comfortable, 30 points from Rose and Ken J. But - disaster! A 4th place at his final table left an opening. Ken J was at the table to see it, but could only claim 2nd in that game, leaving his points tantalisingly short. With Rose also unable to capitalise, Danny took yet another Bristol top spot!

We hope everyone enjoyed the tournament! To those coming back to Bristol Bridge Club in October for Riverside Riichi - good luck!
