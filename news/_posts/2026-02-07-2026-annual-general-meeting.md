The club's Annual General Meeting will occur at 8pm on Tuesday 24th February.

The meeting is open to all members. As a reminder, you're a member if you have completed at least one game at a club meetup in the last calendar year.

The meeting will be hosted online, using the [Meetly](https://getmeetly.app/) platform, and the exact meeting link will be posted on the #jkr-west channel of the JanKenRon Discord server 15 minutes before the start time. If you are not a Discord user, you may instead have the meeting link emailed to you at the same time; please send an email to bristolriichimahjong@gmail.com to arrange this.

The agenda is being finalised and this post will be updated with the agenda at least a week before the meeting.
