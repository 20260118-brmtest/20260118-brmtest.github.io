Our next meetup is on Saturday 31st May, and we're following it up with an evening social!

For the mahjong:
Where: Watershed Cinema Café Bar
When: 10am to 5.30pm
All abilities welcome. Never played before? We can teach you!
No entry fee, but please purchase food and drink from the venue to support them!

For the social:
Where: Three Brothers Burgers
When: 6pm
Please let us know if you'd like to join! We ran a form over Facebook and Discord to work out interest - if you missed this, no worries, just get in contact over email.
