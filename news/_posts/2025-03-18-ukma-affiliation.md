After the vote passed at the AGM, we have applied for affiliation with the UK Mahjong Association, and I'm pleased to report that today our request was accepted!

All members of Bristol Riichi Mahjong therefore automatically become members of the UKMA, allowing you to attend their meetings. We also get one vote, as a club, on meeting motions.

Many thanks to the UKMA!
