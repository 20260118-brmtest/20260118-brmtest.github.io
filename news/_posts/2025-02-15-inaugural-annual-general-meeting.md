Bristol Riichi Mahjong's first ever Annual General Meeting will occur at 8pm on Sunday 23rd February.

The meeting will be hosted online, in order to allow the maximum number of prospective members to attend. It is open to anyone who has played at least one hand of riichi at any of our meetups in the last year.

We will use the [Meetly](https://getmeetly.app/) platform and the exact meeting link will be posted on the #jkr-west channel of the JanKenRon Discord server 15 minutes before the start time. If you are not a Discord user, you may instead have the meeting link emailed to you at the same time; please send an email to bristolriichimahjong@gmail.com (or contact Tom another way) to arrange this.
