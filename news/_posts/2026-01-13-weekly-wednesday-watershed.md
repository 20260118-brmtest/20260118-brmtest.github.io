We're excited to introduce a brand new series of riichi meetups!

When: EVERY Wednesday evening! Starting 21st Jan

Time: 18:15-22:15

Where: Watershed Cinema Café Bar (1 Canons Road, Bristol, BS1 5TX)

Played in an EMA-style tournament format with timed hanchan and random table draws, these nights are still mainly about having fun with friends. The playing atmosphere is encouraged to be 'casually competitive'.

**Important!** These events are limited to 12 slots and pre-registration is required. To pre-register, post in the `#bristol-chat` channel of the JanKenRon Discord server. Instructions for how to reach this are on our [About page - click here.](/about)

Attendees are requested to stay for the full duration of the evening, allowing two hanchan to be played each club night.

As with all our club events, almost all riichi players are welcome to attend! See our [About page](/about) for our policy on beginners. Players who have only ever played online are very much welcome!

No attendance fee - but please support the venue by purchasing food and drink!
