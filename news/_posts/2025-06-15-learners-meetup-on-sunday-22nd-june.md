Want to try riichi mahjong for the first time? The learners' meetup is designed to be as welcoming as possible to those who are nearly or completely new to riichi!

---

- Where: Watershed Cinema Café Bar
- When: 10am-1pm (then free play afterwards!)
- Cost: free - but please support the venue by purchasing food and/or drink!

It's not all that different from our usual casual meetup, but:

- We plan the tables, and try to sit people together who are at similar points in the learning journey
- For any table that needs it, they'll get a dedicated teacher (one of our regular players) who will guide the table through the rules, and moderate the first few games, answering questions as they come up
- We make sure to play with tiles which have Arabic/Western numerals printed on, for ease of recognition
- We prepare lots of rules reference cards to hand out to anyone who needs it

With that in mind:

- Please let us know if you're coming, so we can find you a table! (It's ok to drop out - just let us know as soon as you can!)
- Please do arrive promptly at 10am! We want everyone to get their drink then start playing around the same time.
- We'll also ask you how much mahjong you've played before - so that you aren't getting taught rules you already know!
- If you're not a learner - come anyway! There's still lots of regular play that happens at the learners' meetup.

For anyone wanting to begin their learning a little early, I can wholeheartedly recommend the Light Grunty channel on YouTube:

Start, of course, with The Basics; if you finish, you can move on to Yaku and Scoring, and then Basic Strategy. I hope you'll find it helpful! They are great lessons - just don't worry about memorising the Japanese terms that the teacher introduces - you don't need them just yet!
